# XSD Schema Assembler

This project aims to assemble, merge, and resolve dependencies in XSD files, allowing complex schemas with multiple `<xs:include>` and `<xs:import>` references to be processed and combined into a single XSD document.

## Overview

The `XSD Schema Assembler` is a TypeScript library that simplifies the merging of multiple XSD files, resolving dependencies, including schema attributes, and merging properties as needed. It is designed for scenarios where schemas reference each other using `<xs:include>` or `<xs:import>`, such as in systems following the Brazilian Fiscal Portal standards.

## Key Features

- **Resolution of `<xs:include>` and Processing of `<xs:import>`**: Automatically loads and merges schema dependencies, replacing `<xs:include>` statements with the contents of the referenced files. For `<xs:import>`, the statement is retained, and the referenced file must be in the same directory as the main file for proper resolution.
- **Preservation of Main Schema Attributes**: Attributes from the main XSD file, such as `targetNamespace`, are retained, while attributes from imported files are only added if they do not conflict with the main schema.
- **Removal of XML Declarations and `<xs:schema>` Tags**: During assembly, the `schema` tags from imported files are removed, ensuring a single `schema` tag in the final XSD.
import xsdAssembler from 'xsd-assembler';

## Usage

Install the lib:

```bash
npm install xsd-assembler
```

Usage:
```typescript
import xsdAssembler from 'xsd-assembler';

const pathToYourFile = '/schemas/enviNFe_v4.00.xsd';

const assembledXSD = await xsdAssembler.assemble(pathToYourFile);
```

**Rembember**: All .xsd files should be in the same folder as your main file, as the example:

```
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅschemas
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ enviNFe_v4.00.xsd
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ leiauteNFe_v4.00.xsd
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tiposBasico_v4.00.xsd
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ xmldsig-core-schema_v1.01.xsd
```
